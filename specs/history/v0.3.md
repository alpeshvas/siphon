# Siphon Spec v0.3

Added filtering and projection.

## Features
- Everything from v0.2
- Filtering with `where` clause
- Field projection/renaming with `select`

## Example

```yaml
version: "0.3"

request:
  path: "/products"

extract:
  id: "$.data.id"
  
  active_item:
    path: "$.data.items[*]"
    where: {status: "active"}
    select: {item_id: "id", item_name: "name"}
```

## Output

```json
{
  "id": "prod_123",
  "active_item": {
    "item_id": 1,
    "item_name": "Widget"
  }
}
```

## Notes
- `where` filters items, returns first match
- `select` projects/renames fields from matched item
- Both are optional and can be used independently
